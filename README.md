# Logistic-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
Did all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms yourself, so to have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.
1.Implemented the gradient descent algorithm from scratch

2.Performed logistic regression with NumPy and Python

3.Created data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
